IDEAS:
- create admin functionality
    - see when users got their PTO (When user wants to get PTO -> admin needs to approve it)
    //create table pending_approvals and when the user requests a PTO
    //admin approves it and the entry will be deleted from table and added to
    //when admin clicks on one item then the pto will be granted
    - some routes will be privileged
